#Lean Bash and SQL by Building a Bike Rental 

#The first thing you need to do is start the terminal. Do that by clicking the "hamburger" menu at the top left of the screen, going to the "terminal" section, and clicking "new terminal". Once you open a new one, type echo hello terminal into the terminal and press enter.

#You are going to build a bike rental shop. It will have a database, and a bash script to interact with the database. Use the terminal to connect to PostgreSQL by entering psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=postgres.

#The table will have a few columns for bike information. First, is a unique ID column. Add a column to the bikes table named bike_id. Give it a type of SERIAL and make it a PRIMARY KEY.

#Use the display command to view the details of the bikes table.

#The first column is set. Add a column named type for the type of bike. Make it a VARCHAR(50) and give it a constraint of NOT NULL.

alter table bikes add column type varchar(50) not null;

#Display the details of the bikes table again.

#The first two columns look good. Add a column named size to the bikes table that is an INT and has the NOT NULL constraint. This will be for the size of each bike.

alter table bikes add column size int not null;

#Add another column to the table named available. Make it a boolean and has a constraint of NOT NULL. Also give it a default value of TRUE. This will be set to false when someone rents out a bike.

#Display the details of the bikes table again so you can make sure it's how you want it.

#That table is done for now. Create another table named customers. It will store a name and phone number for each customer that rents a bike.

#Add a rental_id column to your new table. Make it automatically increment with SERIAL and make it the primary key for this table.

alter table rentals add column rental_id serial primary key;

#Next, you need a column for the customer who is renting a bike. Add column named customer_id. This will have an id of a customer from the customers table. Make the column an INT and NOT NULL to start.

alter table rentals add column customer_id int not null;

#Make the column you just added a foreign key that references the customer_id column from the customers table. Here's an example of how you can do that:

alter table rentals add foreign key(customer_id) references customers(customer_id);

#Display the details of the rentals table to make sure your key is set.

#Display the details of the rentals table so you can make sure the key is correct.

#Moving along. You want to know when a customer rents a bike, and when it gets returned. Add a column to your rentals table named date_rented that's a type of DATE. Make sure the entry can't be null, and give it a default value of NOW().

alter table rentals add column date_rented date default(now()) not null;

#Your current inventory is all added. For the rest of the project, I recommend leaving that terminal open and connected, and that you should "split" the terminal so you have a second one to use for bash commands. Do that by clicking the "hamburger" menu at the top left of the window, going to the "terminal" section, and clicking "split terminal". After you have opened it, use the touch command to create a file named bike-shop.sh in the project folder.

touch bike-shop.sh

#This file will be the program for your bike rental shop. Open the file and add a "shebang" at the top so it uses bash when it's executed. If you don't remember, it looks like this: #!/bin/bash.

#!/bin/bash

#In the file, use echo with the -e flag to print ~~~~~ Bike Rental Shop ~~~~~ with a new line at the beginning and end.

echo -e "\n~~~~~ Bike Rental Shop ~~~~~\n"

#Use the terminal (not the psql one) and the chmod command to make your file executable. Add the +x flag and bike-shop.sh to the command to do that.

chmod +x bike-shop.sh

#Type ./bike-shop.sh in the terminal to run your script.
