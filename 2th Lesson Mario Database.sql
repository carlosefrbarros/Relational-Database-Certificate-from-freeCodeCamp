#Learn Relational Databases by Building a Mario Database

/*The first thing you need to do is start the terminal. Do that by clicking the "hamburger" menu at the top left of the screen, going to the "terminal" section, and clicking "new terminal". Once you open a new one, type echo hello PostgreSQL into the terminal and press enter.*/

echo hello PostgreSQL

/*Your virtual machine comes with PostgreSQL installed. You will use the Psql terminal application to interact with it. Log in by typing psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=postgres into the terminal and pressing enter.*/

psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=postgres

/*Notice that the prompt changed to let you know that you are now interacting with PostgreSQL. First thing to do is see what databases are here. Type \l into the prompt to list them.*/

\l

/*The databases you see are there by default. You can make your own like this:
CREATE DATABASE database_name;
The capitalized words are keywords telling PostgreSQL what to do. The name of the database is the lowercase word. Note that all commands need a semi-colon at the end. Create a new database named first_database.*/

create database first_database;

#Use the list shortcut command again to make sure your new database is there.

\l

/*It worked. Your new database is there. If you don't get a message after entering a command, it means it's incomplete and you likely forgot the semi-colon. You can just add it on the next line and press enter to finish the command. Create another database named second_database.*/

create database second_database;

/*You should have another new database now. List the databases to make sure.*/

\l

/*You can connect to a database by entering \c database_name. You need to connect to add information. Connect to your second_database.*/

\c second_database;

/*You should see a message that you are connected. Notice that the prompt changed to second_database=>. So the postgres=> prompt before must have meant you were connected to that database. A database is made of tables that hold your data. Enter \d to display the tables.*/

\d

/*Looks like theres no tables or relations yet. Similar to how you created a database, you can create a table like this:
CREATE TABLE table_name();
Note that the parenthesis are needed for this one. It will create the table in the database you are connected to. Create a table named first_table in second_database.*/

create table first_table();

/*View the tables in second_database again with the display command. You should see your new table there with a little meta data about it.*/

\d

/*Create another new table in this database. Give it a name of second_table.*/

create table second_table();

/*There should be two tables in this database now. Display them again to make sure.*/

\d

/*You can view more details about a table by adding the table name after the display command like this: \d table_name. View more details about your second_table.*/

\d second_table;

/*Tables need columns to describe the data in them, yours doesn't have any yet. Here's an example of how to add one:
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name DATATYPE;
Add a column to second_table named first_column. Give it a data type of INT. INT stands for integer. Don't forget the semi-colon. ðŸ˜„*/

alter table second_table add column first_column int;

/*Looks like it worked. Display the details of second_table again to see if your new column is there.*/

\d second_table

/*Your column is there ðŸ˜„ Use ALTER TABLE and ADD COLUMN to add another column to second_table named id that's a type of INT.*/

alter table second_table add column id int;

/*Your table should have an id column added. View the details of second_table to make sure.*/

\d second_table

/*Add another column to second_table named age. Give it a data type of INT.*/

alter table second_table add column age int;

/*Take a look at the details of second_table again.*/

\d second_table;

/*Those are some good looking columns. You will probably need to know how to remove them. Here's an example:
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name;
Drop your age column.*/

alter table second_table drop column age;

/*View the details of second_table to see if it's gone.*/

\d second_table;

/*It's gone. Use the ALTER TABLE and DROP COLUMN keywords again to drop first_column.*/

alter table second_table drop column first_column;

/*A common data type is VARCHAR. It's a short string of characters. You need to give it a maximum length when using it like this: VARCHAR(30).
Add a new column to second_table, give it a name of name and a data type of VARCHAR(30).*/

alter table second_table add column name varchar(30);

/*Take a look at the details of second_table to see your columns.*/

\d second_table;

/*You can see the VARCHAR type there. The 30 means the data in it can be a max of 30 characters. You named that column name, it should have been username. Here's how you can rename a column:
ALTER TABLE table_name RENAME COLUMN column_name TO new_name;
Rename the name column to username.*/

alter table second_table rename column name to username;

/*Take a look at the details of second_table again to see if it got renamed.*/

\d second_table;

/*It worked. Rows are the actual data in the table. You can add one like this:
INSERT INTO table_name(column_1, column_2) VALUES(value1, value2);
Insert a row into second_table. Give it an id of 1, and a username of Samus. The username column expects a VARCHAR, so you need to put Samus in single quotes like this: 'Samus'.*/

insert into second table (id, username) values ('1', 'Samus');

/*You should have one row in your table. You can view the data in a table by querying it with the SELECT statement. Here's how it looks:
SELECT columns FROM table_name;
Use a SELECT statement to view all the columns in second_table. Use an asterisk (*) to denote that you want to see all the columns.*/

select * from second_table;

/*There's your one row. Insert another row into second_table. Fill in the id and username columns with the values 2 and 'Mario'.*/

insert into second_table (id, username) values ('2', 'Mario');

select * from second_table;

/*Insert another row into second_table. Use 3 as the id, and Luigi as the username this time.*/

inser into second_table (id, username) values ('3', 'Luigi');

/*You should now have three rows. Use SELECT again to see all the data you entered.*/

select * from second_table;

/*That gives me an idea ðŸ˜ƒ You can make a database of Mario video game characters. You should start from scratch for it. Why don't you delete the record you just entered. Here's an example of how to delete a row:
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
Remove Luigi from your table. The condition you want to use is username='Luigi'.*/

delete from second_table where username = 'Luigi';

/*Luigi should be gone. Use SELECT again to see all the data and make sure he's not there.*/

delete from second_table where username = 'Samus';

\d second_table;

/*There's two columns. You won't need either of them for the Mario database. Alter the table second_table and drop the column username.*/

alter table second_table drop column username;

/*Next, drop the id column.*/

alter table second_table drop column column id;

/*Okay, the table has no rows or columns left. View the tables in this database to see what is here.*/

\d

/*Still two. You won't need either of those for the new database either. Drop second_table from your database. Here's an example:
DROP TABLE table_name;*/

drop table second_table;

/*Next, drop first_table from the database.*/

drop table first_table;

/*Connect to your newly named database so you can start adding your characters.*/

/*Okay, I think you're ready to get started. I don't think you created any tables here, take a look to make sure.*/

\d

/*Create a new table named characters, it will hold some basic information about Mario characters.*/

create table characters();

/*Next, you can add some columns to the table. Add a column named character_id to your new table that is a type of SERIAL.*/

alter table characters add column character_id serial;

/*The SERIAL type will make your column an INT with a NOT NULL constraint, and automatically increment the integer when a new row is added. View the details of the characters table to see what SERIAL did for you.*/

('Peach', 'Mushroom Kingdom', 'Pink');
Add two more rows. Give the first one the values: Toadstool, Mushroom Kingdom, and Red. Give the second one: Bowser, Mushroom Kingdom, and Green. Try to add them with one command.*/

select * from characters order by character_id;

/*It looks good. Next, you are going to add a primary key. It's a column that uniquely identifies each row in the table. Here's an example of how to set a PRIMARY KEY:
