#Learn Relational Databases by Building a Mario Database

/*The first thing you need to do is start the terminal. Do that by clicking the "hamburger" menu at the top left of the screen, going to the "terminal" section, and clicking "new terminal". Once you open a new one, type echo hello PostgreSQL into the terminal and press enter.*/

echo hello PostgreSQL

/*Your virtual machine comes with PostgreSQL installed. You will use the Psql terminal application to interact with it. Log in by typing psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=postgres into the terminal and pressing enter.*/

psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=postgres

/*Notice that the prompt changed to let you know that you are now interacting with PostgreSQL. First thing to do is see what databases are here. Type \l into the prompt to list them.*/

\l

/*The databases you see are there by default. You can make your own like this:
CREATE DATABASE database_name;
The capitalized words are keywords telling PostgreSQL what to do. The name of the database is the lowercase word. Note that all commands need a semi-colon at the end. Create a new database named first_database.*/

create database first_database;

#Use the list shortcut command again to make sure your new database is there.

\l

/*It worked. Your new database is there. If you don't get a message after entering a command, it means it's incomplete and you likely forgot the semi-colon. You can just add it on the next line and press enter to finish the command. Create another database named second_database.*/

create database second_database;

/*You should have another new database now. List the databases to make sure.*/

\l

/*You can connect to a database by entering \c database_name. You need to connect to add information. Connect to your second_database.*/

\c second_database;

/*You should see a message that you are connected. Notice that the prompt changed to second_database=>. So the postgres=> prompt before must have meant you were connected to that database. A database is made of tables that hold your data. Enter \d to display the tables.*/

\d

/*Looks like theres no tables or relations yet. Similar to how you created a database, you can create a table like this:
CREATE TABLE table_name();
Note that the parenthesis are needed for this one. It will create the table in the database you are connected to. Create a table named first_table in second_database.*/

create table first_table();

/*View the tables in second_database again with the display command. You should see your new table there with a little meta data about it.*/

\d

/*Create another new table in this database. Give it a name of second_table.*/

create table second_table();

/*There should be two tables in this database now. Display them again to make sure.*/

\d

/*You can view more details about a table by adding the table name after the display command like this: \d table_name. View more details about your second_table.*/

\d second_table;

/*Tables need columns to describe the data in them, yours doesn't have any yet. Here's an example of how to add one:
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name DATATYPE;
Add a column to second_table named first_column. Give it a data type of INT. INT stands for integer. Don't forget the semi-colon. ðŸ˜„*/

alter table second_table add column first_column int;

/*Looks like it worked. Display the details of second_table again to see if your new column is there.*/

\d second_table

/*Your column is there ðŸ˜„ Use ALTER TABLE and ADD COLUMN to add another column to second_table named id that's a type of INT.*/

alter table second_table add column id int;

/*Your table should have an id column added. View the details of second_table to make sure.*/

\d second_table

/*Add another column to second_table named age. Give it a data type of INT.*/

alter table second_table add column age int;

/*Take a look at the details of second_table again.*/

\d second_table;

/*Those are some good looking columns. You will probably need to know how to remove them. Here's an example:
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name;
Drop your age column.*/

alter table second_table drop column age;

/*View the details of second_table to see if it's gone.*/

\d second_table;

/*It's gone. Use the ALTER TABLE and DROP COLUMN keywords again to drop first_column.*/

alter table second_table drop column first_column;

/*A common data type is VARCHAR. It's a short string of characters. You need to give it a maximum length when using it like this: VARCHAR(30).
Add a new column to second_table, give it a name of name and a data type of VARCHAR(30).*/

alter table second_table add column name varchar(30);

/*Take a look at the details of second_table to see your columns.*/

\d second_table;

/*You can see the VARCHAR type there. The 30 means the data in it can be a max of 30 characters. You named that column name, it should have been username. Here's how you can rename a column:
ALTER TABLE table_name RENAME COLUMN column_name TO new_name;
Rename the name column to username.*/

alter table second_table rename column name to username;

/*Take a look at the details of second_table again to see if it got renamed.*/

\d second_table;

/*It worked. Rows are the actual data in the table. You can add one like this:
INSERT INTO table_name(column_1, column_2) VALUES(value1, value2);
Insert a row into second_table. Give it an id of 1, and a username of Samus. The username column expects a VARCHAR, so you need to put Samus in single quotes like this: 'Samus'.*/

insert into second table (id, username) values ('1', 'Samus');

/*You should have one row in your table. You can view the data in a table by querying it with the SELECT statement. Here's how it looks:
SELECT columns FROM table_name;
Use a SELECT statement to view all the columns in second_table. Use an asterisk (*) to denote that you want to see all the columns.*/

select * from second_table;

/*There's your one row. Insert another row into second_table. Fill in the id and username columns with the values 2 and 'Mario'.*/

insert into second_table (id, username) values ('2', 'Mario');

/*You should now have two rows in the table. Use SELECT again to view all the columns and rows from second_table.*/

select * from second_table;

/*Insert another row into second_table. Use 3 as the id, and Luigi as the username this time.*/

inser into second_table (id, username) values ('3', 'Luigi');

/*You should now have three rows. Use SELECT again to see all the data you entered.*/

select * from second_table;

/*That gives me an idea ðŸ˜ƒ You can make a database of Mario video game characters. You should start from scratch for it. Why don't you delete the record you just entered. Here's an example of how to delete a row:
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
Remove Luigi from your table. The condition you want to use is username='Luigi'.*/

delete from second_table where username = 'Luigi';

/*Luigi should be gone. Use SELECT again to see all the data and make sure he's not there.*/

select * from second_table;

/*It's gone. You can scrap all this for the new database. Delete Mario from second_table using the same command as before, except make the condition username='Mario' this time.*/

delete from second_table where username = 'Mario';

/*Only one more row should remain. Delete Samus from second_table.*/

delete from second_table where username = 'Samus';

/*Use SELECT again to see all the rows in second_table to make sure they're gone.*/

select * from second_table;

/*Looks like they're all gone. Remind yourself what columns you have in second_table by looking at its details.*/

\d second_table;

/*There's two columns. You won't need either of them for the Mario database. Alter the table second_table and drop the column username.*/

alter table second_table drop column username;

/*Next, drop the id column.*/

alter table second_table drop column column id;

/*Okay, the table has no rows or columns left. View the tables in this database to see what is here.*/

\d

/*Still two. You won't need either of those for the new database either. Drop second_table from your database. Here's an example:
DROP TABLE table_name;*/

drop table second_table;

/*Next, drop first_table from the database.*/

drop table first_table;

/*All the tables are gone now, too. View all the databases using the command to list them.*/

\l

/*Rename first_database to mario_database. You can rename a database like this:
ALTER DATABASE database_name RENAME TO new_database_name;*/

alter database first_database rename to mario_database;

/*List the databases to make sure it got renamed.*/

\l

/*Connect to your newly named database so you can start adding your characters.*/

\c mario_database;

/*Now that you aren't connected to second_database, you can drop it. Use the DROP DATABASE keywords to do that.*/

drop database second_database;

/*List the databases again to make sure it's gone.*/

\l

/*Okay, I think you're ready to get started. I don't think you created any tables here, take a look to make sure.*/

\d

/*Create a new table named characters, it will hold some basic information about Mario characters.*/

create table characters();

/*Next, you can add some columns to the table. Add a column named character_id to your new table that is a type of SERIAL.*/

alter table characters add column character_id serial;

/*The SERIAL type will make your column an INT with a NOT NULL constraint, and automatically increment the integer when a new row is added. View the details of the characters table to see what SERIAL did for you.*/

\d characters;

/*Add a column to characters called name. Give it a data type of VARCHAR(30), and a constraint of NOT NULL. Add a constraint by putting it right after the data type.*/

alter table characters add column name varchar(30) not null;

/*You can make another column for where they are from. Add another column named homeland. Give it a data type of VARCHAR that has a max length of 60.*/

alter table characters add column homeland varchar(60);

/*Video game characters are quite colorful. Add one more column named favorite_color. Make it a VARCHAR with a max length of 30.*/

/*You are ready to start adding some rows. First is Mario. Earlier, you used this command to add a row:
INSERT INTO second_table(id, username) VALUES(1, 'Samus');
The first parenthesis is for the column names, you can put as many columns as you want. The second parenthesis is for the values for those columns. Add a row to your table, give it a name of Mario, a homeland of Mushroom Kingdom, and a favorite_color of Red. Make sure to use single quotes where needed.*/

/*View all the data in your characters table with SELECT again.*/

select * from characters;

/*Okay, it looks like it's all working. Add another row for Peach. Give her the values: Peach, Mushroom Kingdom, and Pink.*/

insert into characters(name, homeland, favorite_color) values ('Peach', 'Mushroom Kingdom', 'Pink');

/*Adding rows one at a time is quite tedious. Here's an example of how you could have added the previous three rows at once:
INSERT INTO characters(name, homeland, favorite_color)
VALUES('Mario', 'Mushroom Kingdom', 'Red'),
('Luigi', 'Mushroom Kingdom', 'Green'),
('Peach', 'Mushroom Kingdom', 'Pink');
Add two more rows. Give the first one the values: Toadstool, Mushroom Kingdom, and Red. Give the second one: Bowser, Mushroom Kingdom, and Green. Try to add them with one command.*/

UPDATE table_name SET column_name=new_value WHERE condition;
You used username='Samus' as a condition earlier. SET Daisy's favorite_color to Orange. You can use the condition name='Daisy' to change her row.*/

update characters set favorite_color = 'Orange' where name = 'Daisy';

/*The command you just used does exactly what it sounds like. It finds the row where name is Daisy, and sets her favorite_color to Orange. Take a look at all the data in your table again to see if she got updated.*/

select * from characters;

/*Using favorite_color='Red' was not a good idea. Mario's name changed to Toad because he likes red, and now there's two rows that are the same. Well, almost. Only the character_id is different. You will have to use that to change it back to Mario. Use UPDATE to set the name to Mario for the row with the lowest character_id.*/

update characters set name = 'Mario' where character_id = '1';

/*Take a look at all the data in your table again to see if Mario's name got changed back.*/

select * from characters;

update characters set favorite_color = 'Blue' where character_id = '4';

/*Bowser's favorite_color is wrong. He likes Yellow. Why don't you update it without changing any of the other rows?*/

update characters set favorite_color = 'Yellow' where character_id = '5';

/*Bowser's homeland is wrong as well. He's from the Koopa Kingdom. Why don't you change it to that without changing any other rows?*/

update characters set homeland = 'Koopa Kingdom' where character_id = '5';

/*Take a look at all the data in your table again to make sure there's no more issues.*/

select * from characters;

/*Actually, you should put that in order. Here's an example:
SELECT columns FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name;
View all the data again, but put it in order by character_id.*/

select * from characters order by character_id;

/*It looks good. Next, you are going to add a primary key. It's a column that uniquely identifies each row in the table. Here's an example of how to set a PRIMARY KEY:
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD PRIMARY KEY(column_name);
The name column is pretty unique, why don't you set that as the primary key for this table.*/

alter table characters add primary key(name);

/*You should set a primary key on every table and there can only be one per table. Take a look at the details of your characters table to see the primary key at the bottom.*/

\d characters;

/*You can see the key for your name column at the bottom. It would have been better to use character_id for the primary key. Here's an example of how to drop a constraint:
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP CONSTRAINT constraint_name;
Drop the primary key on the name column. You can see the constraint name is characters_pkey.*/

alter table characters drop constraint characters_pkey
